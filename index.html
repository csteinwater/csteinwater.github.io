<h1>Hey there!</h1>
<p>I'm just launching my coding career. I'm interested in cybersecurity, programming, and data anlytics.</p>
<p>I'm super stoked about learning python. I've been reading a lot of the documentation. I've even adopted some of the naming standards--I named my new puppy Pydog.</p>
<p>I'll be posting updates, hopefully regularly.</p>
